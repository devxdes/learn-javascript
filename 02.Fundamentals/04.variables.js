// A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.

console.log(announcement);

// We Can Also Declare Multiple Variables

let User = 'John', Age = 25, Message = "Hello"
// That might seem shorter, but we don’t recommend it. For the sake of better readability, please use a single line per variable.


let user = 'John';
let age = 25;
let message = 'Hello';

/*  
In Line number 11 and line number 15-17, we have used same names, but got no error, it is because of case sensitivity, in line 11, we have used title case, the first letter of variable is Capital, but in line 15-17, the variables name are in small letters.
*/

// we can also declare multiple variables, with keyword used once, here is an example

let username = 'John',
    password = '123',
    email = 'john@example.com'


// We Can use Keywords like var, let, and const to store variables
